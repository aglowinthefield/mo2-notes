This is a simple yet powerful markdown editor with live preview. Here's a quick overview of what you can do:

## Basic Formatting

You can write text in **bold** or *italic*, or even ***both***!
~You can strike through if you want, also ~

### Lists and Tasks

Here are some things you can try:
- Basic bullet points
- [ ] Unchecked tasks
- [x] Completed tasks
  - Nested items work too!

Numeric lists work like:
1. one, hit enter and it magically becomes...
2.  two :)

### Code Blocks

Inline code looks like `this`. You can also create code:

```cpp
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
I know the syntax highlighting is a bit ugly right now. Patience please! You can remove the language
annotation (`cpp`) to just do raw text in a block.
